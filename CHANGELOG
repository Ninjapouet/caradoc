- Use standard exception Exit where relevant.

- Changed the parameters of the 'object' command for easier extraction of
  streams: removed --relax-streams and replaced --decode-streams by --raw-stream
  and --decoded-stream.

- Removed the parameter --stream-errors from the 'extract' command. This
  parameter was not used in the code.

- Changed the minimum allowed integer to -2^31. Reported by Chimrod.

- Use open_in_bin and open_out_bin instead of open_in and open_out. Suggested by
  Chimrod.

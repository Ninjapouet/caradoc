New features:
- Added the 'findref' command to find all references to an object.
- Added the 'findname' command to find all occurrences of a PDF name.
- Added --allow-nonascii-in-names option to allow names to contain non-ASCII
  characters instead of the corresponding escape sequence.
- Added --allow-overlaps option to allow several objects to overlap in a file.
- When available, the 'stats' command also outputs main metadata from the /Info
  dictionary (/Producer, /Creator, /CreationDate and /ModDate).

Misc:
- Improved error handling.
- Improved implementation of --undefined-ref-as-null option.

-------------------
Version 0.2 (beta):
-------------------

Breaking changes:
- Removed the parameter --stream-errors from the 'extract' command. This
  parameter was not used in the code.
- Changed the parameters of the 'object' command for easier extraction of
  streams: removed --relax-streams and replaced --decode-streams by --raw-stream
  and --decoded-stream.

API Changes:
- Split the PDFObject module into DirectObject and IndirectObject modules. This
  design enforces the semantics of direct and indirect objects.
- Created the PDFStream module to encapsulate operations on streams and ensure
  consistency between encoded and decoded data.

New features:
- Added support for ASCII85 and RunLength stream filters.
- Added --rencode-streams option to the 'cleanup' command to reencode all
  streams with a chosen filter.

Bugfixes:
- Use open_in_bin and open_out_bin instead of open_in and open_out. Suggested by
  Chimrod.
- Changed the minimum allowed integer to -2^31. Reported by Chimrod.
- Allowed to use indirect objects as stream parameters (/Length, /Filter or
  /DecodeParms) with the relaxed parser. Suggested by Chimrod.

Misc:
- Use standard exception Exit where relevant.
- Use Buffer module instead of string concatenation to reduce complexity.

-------------------
Version 0.1 (beta):
-------------------

- Initial public release.
